# Vanilla-FeedForward-Neural-Net
Task is to create a vanilla neural network implementation with a variable number of layers and nodes per layer.

A simple feedforward neural network consists of :

1) Input layer x

2) Arbitary amount of hidden layers

3) An Output layer 

4) A Set of weights and biases(w &b)

5) Activation Function (Sigmoid Activation function)

This is a neural network that deos not use any of the deep learning library like TensorFlow and Caffe and is a simple two layer neural network architecture.
